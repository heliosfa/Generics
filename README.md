# Generics Software
This is the "official" Git repository for Professor Andrew Brown's Generics Software collection.

This is used across multiple projects and it needed a nicer home than a shared network drive in the University of Southampton.

This is mostly written in C++98, though a C++98<>C++11 compatibility header is provided as `OSFixes.hpp` for some useful functionality.

Documentation can be found in the `docs` folder.
